# Airflow with Docker

Note:
- Airflow is built to integrate with all databases, systems, and cloud environments
> - Managing and maintaining all of the dependencies changes will be really difficult
> - Takes lots of time to set up and config Airflow env
> - How to share development and production environments for all developers

## Using Docker

- Frees developers from the task of managing and maintaining all of the Airflow dependencies and deployment
- Easy to share and deploy different versions and environments
- Keep track of tags and releases (from Github)
- Ease of deployment from testing to production environment
